<b>Welcome to the RTÂ² Lab!</b> We are a group of researchers (from Computer Science and Engineering backgrounds) designing <i>teaching</i> and <i>teaching</i> technologies
to improve how people work with robots.

Our lab develops *algorithms, interfaces, and systems* to enable more effective human-robot teaming. A major application areaw we study is manufacturing, where many tasks are difficult for people (e.g., physically demanding) and difficult to automate (i.e., highly variable). Our research spans three key areas:
- **Human-Centered Teaching Tools** -- Teaching new tasks to robots -- especially for tasks involving contact of dexterous manipulation -- remains a challenge. In developing solutions, we engage directly with domain experts to design solutions that are effective and usable. We develop novel physical interfaces and end-user programming approaches to make it easier for humans to task and retask robots.
- **Uncertainty-Aware Shared Autonomy** -- Achieving robust autonomy is pervasive in many settings, such as when there is limited data or tasks are complex, contact-rich, or underdefined. We investigate how robots can *self-assess* their confidence and selectivvely minimize human input. We also explore the intersection of shared autonomy and emergent robot learning approaches (e.g., generative AI).
- **Contextualized Systems and Human Studies** -- We partner with domain experts to understand challenges related to adoption of robot technologies and to evaluation our teaming and teaming technologies across diverse tasks and end users. We design/evaluate our technologies using tools from human-centered design.
