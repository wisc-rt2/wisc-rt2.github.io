<b>Welcome to the RT² Lab!</b> We are a group of researchers (from Computer Science and Engineering backgrounds) designing <i>teaching</i> and <i>teaching</i> technologies
to improve how people work with robots.

Our lab develops *algorithms, interfaces, and systems* with a goal of enabling better human-robot teaming. One of our major application areas we study is manufacturing, where many tasks are difficult for people (e.g., physically demanding) and difficult to automate (i.e., highly variable). The RT² Lab focuses on a few main threads of research:
- **Human-Centered Teaching Tools** -- It is still difficult to teach robots new tasks, particularly when the task involves contact or dexterious manipulation. We are developing new physical interfaces and end-user programming approaches to make it easier for humans to task and retask robots.
- **Uncertainty-Aware Shared Autonomy**. We also explore the interface between SC/SA approaches and emergent robot learning (e.g., generative AI)
- **Systems and Applications** -- We work directly with domain experts to understand challenges related to adoption of robot technologies and to cross-evaluate our teaming and teaming technologies across different tasks and different end users. We leverage tools from human-centered design.
